# Feature Ideas to Enhance Long D&D Session Transcriptions

1. **Adaptive Scene Segmentation Dashboard**
   - Build a visualization layer that automatically clusters the transcript into narrative "scenes" (e.g., combat, roleplay, exploration) by analyzing speaker turns, sentiment, and custom campaign tags.
   - Surface a timeline view showing where key transitions occur so DMs can jump directly to important story beats during review.

2. **NPC Voice & Lore Memory Panel**
   - Track recurring NPC speaker embeddings and associate them with lore notes, portraits, and previous dialogue snippets.
   - Suggest consistent spellings and voice descriptors to maintain continuity across multi-session campaigns.

3. **Rules Reference Linker**
   - Detect mentions of spells, abilities, and rules citations, then automatically hyperlink them to SRD or homebrew compendium entries.
   - Provide quick inline tooltips within the transcript to accelerate rules lookup during prep.

4. **Decision Bookmarking Workflow**
   - Allow DMs to insert bookmarks or TODOs while listening that capture unresolved choices, loot assignments, or foreshadowing hooks.
   - Integrate bookmarks with a task tracker so action items roll forward into the next session agenda.

5. **Noise-Aware Re-Transcription Queue**
   - Monitor ASR confidence scores and background noise estimates to flag low-quality segments.
   - Offer a batch re-transcription queue with enhanced models or user-provided corrections to iteratively improve accuracy over time.
